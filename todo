FIXME:
    when using a 10min interval notice, and complete a task.
    Then start another, the notice remains and does not start a new 10min count.(it will notice you in 3minutes or some other)
    and why the interval changeTo 5min?

    ::the startTimer function is too large with too much responsibilities
FIXME:
    startBtn does not update progress
