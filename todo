DATABASESHOW
FIXME:
    [done!] use a right path(the same path with guitimer.py) instead of 'event.db'
	:: use getattr( sys, 'executable', False ): in config.py

FIXME:
    when using a 10min interval notice, and complete a task. 
    Then start another, the notice remains and does not start a new 10min count.(it will notice you in 3minutes or some other)
    and why the interval changeTo 5min?

	::the startTimer function is too large with too much responsibilities
